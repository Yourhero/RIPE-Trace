RIPE-Trace
==========

Mass traceroute using RIPE API

Python code to start a RIPE Atlas UDM (User-Defined
Measurement) and display new and archived data.
This one is for running IPv4 or IPv6 traceroute queries
to analyze routing

You'll need an API key in ~/.atlas/auth.

New:
 - displays human readable results.
 - can call archived measurements

*Credit to the RIPE community for writing the core of this code*
